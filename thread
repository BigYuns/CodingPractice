servers [0, ... 39] len = 40

each number represent a server.
You have a massive file stored in server 0.

There is manager server that manages copy operation.
Each server can do maximum of 3 concurrent copies at a time. 





def doCopy(src,dest):
    copyFile(src, dest)
    available_workers.enqueue(src)
    for x in range(3):
        available_workers.enqueue(dest)
    
    
copyFile(src, dest) # this method will block while copy proceeds 

Thread.run(func)

def populate():
""" This function will copy a big file from server 0 to all of the servers. This method needs to return only when all copies has finished. """
    available_workers = Queue()
    available_dest = servers
    
    start = available_dest.pop() # 0
    for x in range (3):
        availble_workers.queue(start)  # queue = [0,0,0]
    
    while(available_dest):
        src = available_workers.dequeue() #gets called after enqueue from worker
        dest = available_dest.pop()
        
        thread.run(doCopy(src,dest))
